# Moyai | Version 0.96
Moyai is a versatile Discord bot that uses Python and Discord.py to interact with Discord's API. It offers more than 40 commands for various purposes. 
Moyai aims to enhance the Discord experience by integrating programs such as OpenAI's GPT-3, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion. Stable Diffusion is a superior
alternative to DALL-E for generating images from text.

## Managing Utilities 
With the aim of effectively showcasing our five utilities, we will be presenting a clear classification and demonstration of the utilization of each individual function. Within the Discord platform, we have organized and classified our functions to facilitate execution through a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI).

## Mod Manager
In order to provide efficient moderation to our staff members, we have integrated our moderation functions into our GUI utility. This allows staff members to quickly and easily execute necessary functions. Please note that this utility is intended for use by staff members with an active server and is not applicable to non-staff users.

## Music Manager
As of right now, only three functions are working. The "summon", "join", and "play" functions are working.

## SQL Manager
We are reworking this utility. It is very limited on what a user can do with this.

## Support Manager
We are reworking this utility. It is very limited on what a user can do with these functions. However, we are going to
implement features that will help server members.

## New Features
We have incorporated third-party programs into Moyai to enhance its capabilities and make it a more intelligent and versatile bot. These programs include OpenAI’s GPT-3, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion. We are currently in the process of integrating GPT-4, the latest version of OpenAI’s AI technology. Our team is constantly exploring new program integrations to further improve Moyai. Additionally, we are revamping our SQL utility and support utility to provide better service to our users.

## Future Updates
As previously mentioned, we are in the process of enhancing our SQL utility. We are utilizing Python’s SQLite library to provide users with the ability to create databases and perform other related tasks. Additionally, we are improving our support utility to better serve our users. Our top priority at the moment is to fully operationalize our music utility, as some functions are not yet functional.
