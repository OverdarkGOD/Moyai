# Moyai | Version 0.96.2
Moyai is a versatile Discord bot that utilizes Python and Discord.py to interact with Discord’s API. With over 40 commands available for various purposes, Moyai aims to enhance the Discord experience by integrating advanced programs such as OpenAI’s GPT-3, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion. Stable Diffusion is a superior alternative to DALL-E for generating images from text. To invite Moyai to your server, please use the following link: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=865139184138321930&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands.

## Managing Utilities 
With the aim of effectively showcasing our five utilities, we will be presenting a clear classification and demonstration of the utilization of each individual function. Within the Discord platform, we have organized and classified our functions to facilitate execution through a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI).

## Mod Manager
In order to expedite the moderation process, our moderation functions will not be integrated into our GUI utility. This allows staff members to swiftly execute these functions and maintain their server effectively.

## Support Manager
We are reworking this utility. It is very limited on what a user can do with these functions. However, we are going to
implement features that will help server members.

## New Features
We have incorporated third-party programs into Moyai to enhance its capabilities and make it a more intelligent and versatile bot. These programs include OpenAI’s GPT-3, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion. We are currently in the process of integrating GPT-4, the latest version of OpenAI’s AI technology. We are pleased to announce that our team has resolved the issue with our SQL utility. Users are now able to create databases to meet their specific needs.

## Future Updates
As previously mentioned, our team has resolved the issue with our SQL utility and we are continuously working to add new features to enhance its functionality. We are also actively developing our Support Manager and Music Manager, and constantly implementing new functions. We are pleased to announce that we have been invited to integrate OpenAI’s GPT-4 AI technology into our bot. This will enhance its capabilities and make it a more intelligent and versatile tool for our users.
